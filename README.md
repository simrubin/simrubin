# Hi, I'm Simeon Rubin

**Multidisciplinary Designer and Developer**  
*Melbourne, Australia*

Welcome to my personal repository. I'm a creative technologist and Design Engineer working at the intersection of **design and software development**. With a background in **industrial design**, **software development**, and **human-computer interaction**, I build systems that bridge the physical and digital. Whether through thoughtful UI, interactive hardware, or speculative design concepts.
