# 👋 Hi, I'm Simeon Rubin

**Multidisciplinary Designer and Full-Stack Developer**  
_Melbourne, Australia_

Welcome to my personal repository. I'm a creative technologist working at the intersection of **design and software development**. With a background in **industrial design**, **front-end engineering**, and **human-computer interaction**, I build systems that bridge the physical and digital—whether through thoughtful UI, interactive hardware, or speculative design concepts.

## 🌱 About Me

- 🎓 **Double degree graduate** in Industrial Design and IT (Software Development)
- 🎓 Former **Research Assistant at SensiLab**, working on speculative AI and emotional interaction projects (see: *Machine Eye*)
- 🧰 Building interactive tools to teach **web accessibility**, because access to knowledge should be universal
- 🧠 Passionate about the intersection of **design and code**
- 🧪 Currently exploring ways to make **full-stack development** more human-centered and expressive

## 💡 What I Work On

- **Full-stack apps**: React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, Flask/Python, SQLite – deployed with Docker & Azure
- **UI/UX design**: Prototyping interfaces for accessibility, storytelling, and digital wellbeing
- **Creative hardware**: Arduino, Raspberry Pi, tactile interfaces for aging in place and alternative interaction
- **Speculative design**: Design fiction and emotional tech to rethink our future with machines
